<b>YOUR BALONEY DETECTION KIT SUCKS</b><br>Stephen Bond<br><br>

<p>I still remember the thrill of first encountering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131204034043/http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/The_Fine_Art_of_Baloney_Detection">a summary 
of Carl Sagan's Baloney Detection Kit</a>. Reading through the list of logical 
fallacies, I could feel a change come over my being and my posture: my biceps 
bulged, my abs hardened into a carapace, and my gonads turned to solid granite. 
I had discovered the secret weapons cache of the elite commandoes of reason, 
and now I felt invincible. Armed with Sagan's checklist, I was sure I could 
survive any argument undefeated. Creationists, paranormalists and fanboys alike 
would fall before my big guns of logic: I'd mow them all down like Arnie in 
<i>Terminator 2.</i>

</p><p>But when I went on Internet forums and saw the Baloney Detection Kit in 
action, I was shocked and puzzled. Thousands of other people had discovered the 
secret weapons cache, but they were not, as I had expected, blowing away all 
before them. In their hands, the logical fallacy terms did not look like 
decisive weapons; instead, they looked clumsy, cumbersome, easy to 
outmanoeuvre. Why did people who deployed these terms always look so rigid, so 
predictable, so feeble? Why did people who avoided them look so confident in 
comparison, so much more in command of their resources, so much more mature? 
Their arguments seemed to possess an inner strength; the baloney detectors, by 
contrast, only had strength in numbers. Using Sagan's checklist, I thought I'd 
have the gods of reason and logic on my side; instead, <a href="nolongeraskeptic.html">I just had a bunch of bullying creeps.</a>

</p><p>I became rapidly disillusioned with the power of logical fallacies, and over 
time, my disillusionment has only grown. These days, I'm convinced that they have 
no place in most arguments, and in the rest of this article I'll explain why.

</p><h4>LOGICAL FALLACIES ARE USUALLY IRRELEVANT OR CITED INCORRECTLY</h4>

<p>As both my regular readers will know, <a href="fame.html">I made my first 
million dollars</a> by writing a webpage <a href="adhominem.html">explaining 
why the term <i>ad hominem</i> is so often incorrectly used</a>. But I could 
have written the same for any other fallacy in the Baloney Detection Kit; <i>ad 
hominem</i> is only the most frequently invoked. Even on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131204034043/http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/The_Fine_Art_of_Baloney_Detection">rationalwiki 
page</a> about these logical fallacies, <a href="rwikifallacies.html">several of the illustrative examples 
are incorrect.</a> It's very unusual to see a logical fallacy identified correctly in 
the wild, and it's rarer still to see one identified to any good purpose.

</p><p>Logical fallacies are only relevant in certain narrow rhetorical modes and 
contexts. Specifically, logical fallacies are only relevant in rational 
arguments. If a speaker is trying to convince you of the gut-wrenching pathos 
of a situation, then it's irrelevant to call them out on an Appeal to the 
Emotion, because appealing to the emotion is exactly what they're trying to do. 
And even if a speaker is trying to convince you of the mind-wrenching logos of 
a situation, most logical fallacies only come into play when the speaker's 
language is intended to be taken literally. If a speaker is employing irony, 
hyperbole, understatement, whimsy, counterfactual conjecture, or any other of 
the wonders of figurative language that defy semantic nit-picking, then your 
Baloney Detection Kit has nothing to contribute. To further complicate matters, 
rhetorical modes and contexts can shift within an argument. At times a speaker 
can be using literal language, at other times figurative; at times they can 
appeal to the emotions, at other times reason, at other times both, at other 
times neither; at times they may not even be arguing at all. Following the 
shifting contexts of an argument requires careful attention and a note of 
empathy. Baloney detectors who indiscriminately lob in their logical fallacy 
terms tend to look like robots who don't understand human speech.

</p><p>Humans typically communicate in a way that resists shallow logical analysis. 
In a real conversation, people use words rather than terms, make utterances 
rather than sentences, and employ a wider variety of inference methods than 
<i>modus ponens</i>. A great deal of what is communicated and inferred in a 
conversation depends on context; the speakers and audience, their history, 
their shared knowledge and confidences, the feelers they lay out to establish 
mutual trust and rapport. Poking into this with your ad hominem stick betrays an 
ignorance of the way people actually communicate, and ignorance in general. The 
most sedulous baloney detectors are guilty of the same literalism as the 
bible-thumpers they ridicule.

</p><h4>CITING LOGICAL FALLACIES IS USUALLY COWARDLY AND LAZY</h4>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131204034043/http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/saganbd.htm#BALONEY">In coming 
up with the Baloney Detection Kit</a>, Carl Sagan wanted to encourage critical 
thinking; however, in using the kit, it seems most baloney detectors want to 
reject it. Far too often, logical fallacies are invoked in order to run away 
from an argument. Rather than engage with the ideas in a text, it's much easier 
to <a href="smugskimreader.html">skim through it</a> trying to spot a quick 
fallacy; and once a fallacy is found, a baloney detector can safely ignore 
everything else.

</p><p>I must admit that I have often been on the receiving end of this tendency. 
Any time one of my webpages makes it to a discussion board, I see people quote 
a line and say "Ad Hominem!" or "Begging the Question!" or "Faulty Premise!" 
and say no more; these people seem to have no other opinions on the text. And 
then there are people on Reddit who won't read my <a href="ender.html"><i>Ender's Game</i> review</a> because someone told them 
there's a contradiction somewhere. I say there is "no dramatic tension" at one 
point in the review, and "&nbsp;[the writer] makes the pages turn" at another; and 
this apparent contradiction presumably negates the whole argument.

</p><p>As it happens, I don't think there <i>is</i> a contradiction in my <i>Ender's 
Game</i> review — dramatic tension isn't the only thing that makes pages turn
— but even if there were, its arguments probably wouldn't topple 
down. This is because an argument is not the same thing as a mathematical 
proof, and arguing is not the same thing as proof by contradiction. In the real 
world, it's not sufficient simply to identify a fallacy in an argument. You've 
also got to think why the fallacy is a problem in that particular instance, and what 
consequences it could have for the rest of the argument; often it will have 
less consequence than you might think. If you think you've dismissed an 
opposing argument just because you think you've seen a fallacy, then you're 
deluding yourself. But then, lot of baloney detectors seem to prefer 
self-delusion to critical thought — and there's an irony I've laboured 
already.

</p><h4>LOGICAL FALLACIES ARE OFTEN USED TO EXCLUDE</h4>

<p>The most troubling aspect of logical fallacies is their use in suppressing 
uncomfortable ideas and viewpoints, and this can happen whether they are 
invoked correctly or not. I've seen countless examples of fallacies being 
called upon to dismiss other people's opinions and ride over their emotions. 
Used in this way, they are tools of power, summoned to establish and protect a 
self-serving clique.

</p><p>By way of illustration, suppose you are a guy who identifies as a skeptic. 
And then suppose you encounter a woman who tells you that because of the <a href="nolongeraskeptic.html#sexist">insults she has received from guys in the 
skeptic community</a>, she has decided that the skeptic 
movement is fundamentally sexist. Here are a dozen ways <i>not</i> to respond:

</p><blockquote><i>
"You're <b>cherry-picking</b> examples of the worst behaviour. Most of us are nice guys."
</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>
"You're concocting a <b>straw man</b> of skepticism. Most of us are nice guys."
</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>
"I think you're guilty of <b>confirmation bias</b> here — concentrating on all the examples that fit your description of a skeptic asshole, while ignoring the fact that most of us are nice guys."
</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>
"<b></b></i><b>Ad hominem<i></i></b><i>, I'm afraid. You're attacking the people in skepticism, not skepticism itself. By the way, most of us are nice guys."
</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i> "Isn't that <b>begging the question</b>, though? Aren't you 
just saying 'skeptics are bad because skeptics are bad'? If you looked more 
closely, I think you'd find most of us are nice guys." </i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i> "You're <b>confusing correlation and causation</b> here. These 
people are not assholes </i>because<i> they are skeptics, they're assholes who 
</i>happen to be<i> skeptics. Most of us are actually nice guys." 
</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>
"You're <b>drawing conclusions from an insufficient sample size</b>. If you got to know more of us, you'd realise that we were nice guys."
</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i> "<b></b></i><b>Non sequitur<i></i></b><i> there. You think that since these 
guys are assholes, all the rest of us must be. In fact, most of us are nice 
guys." </i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>
"<b></b></i><b>Post hoc ergo propter hoc<i></i></b><i>. No idea what that means, I just thought it would sound clever and impressive. You see -- most of us are actually nice guys!"
</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i> "You're being <b>inconsistent</b> here — it's </i>not<i> 
okay for them to insult you, but it </i>is<i> okay for you to insult us by 
association? We don't deserve that — most of us are nice guys." 
</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>
"What we have here is a case of the <b>fallacy of the excluded middle</b>. You're only considering two extremes of skeptic — assholes or feminists — and ignoring the fact that most of us are simply nice guys."
</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i> "But <b>absence of evidence is not evidence of absence</b>. 
Just because you didn't meet any nice skeptics doesn't mean they don't exist. 
Most of us are actually nice guys."</i></blockquote>

<p>Hopefully it should be clear that none of these are acceptable responses. 
(The fact that most of the logical fallacies are invoked incorrectly is 
irrelevant — and I've got to say, having compiled this list, I find it 
striking how easily interchangeable they all are.) This woman has confided her 
experiences and concerns; in these responses, you are insultingly and 
condescendingly attempting to diminish them, by portraying her experiences as 
irrelevant and her concerns as illogical. Respond like this, and you couldn't 
be more offensive if you said "You're too emotional, my dear: let me correct 
you with the firm hand of reason." In throwing around accusations of logical 
fallacy in such a sensitive context, you're being an asshole. And furthermore, 
you're excluding a voice from your privileged in-group.

</p><p>The Baloney Detection Kit is a cache of offensive weapons, and for many 
discussions it's better to leave it behind and go in unarmed. Not every 
discussion is an argument, and arguments aren't always about winning. This can 
be a difficult concept to grasp, especially for strutting alpha male types like 
myself. But if we want to live in a more just and inclusive world,
it's a concept that's got to sink in.
