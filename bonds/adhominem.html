<p>One of the most widely misused terms on the Net is "ad hominem". It is most 
often introduced into a discussion by certain delicate types, delicate of 
personality and mind, whenever their opponents resort to a bit of <a href="sarcasm.html">sarcasm</a>. As soon as the suspicion of an insult appears, 
they summon the angels of ad hominem to smite down their foes, before ascending to 
argument heaven in a blaze of sanctimonious glory. They may not have much up top, 
but by God, they don't need it when they've got ad hominem on their side. It's 
the secret weapon that delivers them from any argument unscathed.

</p><p>In reality, ad hominem is unrelated to sarcasm or personal abuse. <i>Argumentum 
ad hominem</i> is the <a href="bdksucks.html">logical fallacy</a> of attempting to undermine a speaker's 
argument by attacking the speaker instead of addressing the argument. The mere 
presence of a personal attack does not indicate ad hominem: the attack must be 
used for the purpose of undermining the argument, or otherwise the logical fallacy 
isn't there. It is not a logical fallacy to attack someone; the fallacy comes from 
assuming that a personal attack is also necessarily an attack on that person's 
arguments.

</p><p>Therefore, if you can't demonstrate that your opponent is <i>trying to counter 
your argument</i> by attacking you, you can't demonstrate that he is resorting to 
ad hominem. If your opponent's sarcasm is not an attempt to counter your 
argument, but merely an attempt to insult you (or amuse the bystanders), then it 
is not part of an ad hominem argument.

</p><p>Actual instances of <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> are relatively rare. 
Ironically, the fallacy is most often committed by those who accuse their 
opponents of ad hominem, since they try to dismiss the opposition not by engaging 
with their arguments, but by claiming that they resort to personal attacks. Those 
who are quick to squeal "ad hominem" are often guilty of several other logical 
fallacies, including one of the worst of all: the fallacious belief that 
introducing an impressive-sounding Latin term somehow gives one the decisive edge 
in an argument.

</p><p>But enough vagueness. The point of this article is to bury the reader under an 
avalanche of examples of correct and incorrect usage of ad hominem, in the hope 
that once the avalanche has passed, the term will never be used incorrectly again.

<p></p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be a 
mammal."
<br>B: "This does not logically follow. By your own argument, the set of rodents is
a subset of the set of mammals; and therefore, a weasel can be outside the set of 
rodents and still be in the set of mammals."
</i></blockquote>

<p>Hopefully it should be clear that neither A's argument nor B's argument is
ad hominem. Perhaps there are some people who think that any disagreement
is an ad hominem argument, but these people shouldn't be allowed out of fairyland.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be a 
mammal." 
<br>B: "This does not logically follow."
</i></blockquote>

<p>B's argument is less comprehensive, but still not ad hominem.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be 
a mammal."
<br>B: "This does not logically follow. You evidently know nothing about logic."
</i></blockquote>

<p>B's argument is still not ad hominem. Note that B directly engages A's 
argument: he is not attacking the person A instead of his argument. There 
is no indication that B thinks his subsequent attack on A strengthens his 
argument, or is a substitute for engaging with A's argument. Unless we 
have a good reason for thinking otherwise, we should assume it is just a 
sarcastic flourish.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be
a mammal."
<br>B: "You evidently know nothing about logic. This does not logically follow."
</i></blockquote>

<p>B's argument is still not ad hominem. B does not imply that A's 
sentence does not logically follow <i>because</i> A knows nothing about logic. B 
is still addressing the substance of A's argument.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be
a mammal."
<br>B: "You evidently know nothing about logic."
</i></blockquote>

<p>B's argument is, most probably, <i>still</i> not ad hominem. The word 
"evidently" indicates that B is basing his opinion of A's logical skills on the 
evidence of A's statement. Therefore, B's sentence is a sarcastic way of saying 
that A's argument is logically unsound: B is attacking A's argument. He is not 
attacking the person <i>instead of</i> the argument.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be
a mammal."
<br>B: "You know nothing about logic."
</i></blockquote>

<p><i>Even now</i>, we can't conclude that B's reply is ad hominem. It could well 
be, and probably is, the case that B is basing his reply on A's argument. 
He is not saying that A's argument is flawed because A knows nothing about logic;
instead, he is using A's fallacious argument as evidence to present a <i>new</i>
argument: that A knows nothing about logic.

</p><p>Put briefly, ad hominem is "You are an ignorant person, therefore your 
arguments are wrong", and not "Your arguments are wrong, therefore you are an 
ignorant person." The latter statement may be fallacious, but it's not an 
ad 
hominem fallacy.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be
a mammal."
<br>B: "This does not logically follow. And you're an asshole."
</i></blockquote>

<p>B is abusive, but his argument is still not ad hominem. He engages with 
A's argument. There is no reason to conclude that the personal abuse of A 
is part of B's argument, or that B thinks it undermines A's argument.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be
a mammal."
<br>B: "You're an asshole."
</i></blockquote>

<p>B's reply is not necessarily ad hominem. There is no evidence that's his 
abusive statement is intended as a counter-argument. If it's not an argument, it's 
not an ad hominem argument.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be
a mammal."
<br>B: "You evidently know nothing about logic. And you're an asshole."
</i></blockquote>

<p>Again, B's reply is not necessarily ad hominem.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be
a mammal."
<br>B: "Fuck you."
</i></blockquote>

<p>Not ad hominem. B's abuse is not a counter-argument, but a request 
for A to cease the discussion.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be
a mammal."
<br>B: "Well, you've never had a good grasp of logic, so this can't be true."
</i></blockquote>

<p>B's argument here <i>is</i> ad hominem. He concludes that A is wrong not by
addressing A's argument, but by appealing to the negative image of A the person.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be
a mammal."
<br>B: "Well, you're a moron and an asshole, so there goes your argument."
</i></blockquote>

<p>B's reply here is ad hominem and abusive.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be a 
mammal." 
<br>B: "Well, you're a rodent and a weasel, so there goes your argument."
</i></blockquote>

<p>B's argument here might appear on superficial inspection to be sound, 
but it is in fact ad hominem. He is using the terms "rodent" and "weasel"
in different senses to those used by A. Although he tries to make it appear
that he is countering A's argument by invalidating one of the premises,
he is in fact trying to counter A's argument by heaping abuse on A.
(This might also be an example of an <i>ad homonym</i> argument.)

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All murderers are criminals, but a thief isn't a murderer, and so can't be a
criminal."
<br>B: "Well, you're a thief and a criminal, so there goes your argument."
</i></blockquote>

<p>Harder to call this one. B is addressing A's argument, but perhaps
unwittingly.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be a 
mammal." 
<br>B: "Wrong! If a weasel isn't a rodent, then it must be an insectivore! 
What an asshole!"
</i></blockquote>

<p>B's argument is logically fallacious, and he concludes with some gratuitous 
abuse, but nothing here is ad hominem.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be a
mammal."
<br>B: "I'm sorry, but I'd prefer to trust the opinion of a trained 
zoologist on this one."
</i></blockquote>

<p>B's argument is ad hominem: he is attempting to counter A not by addressing
his argument, but by casting doubt on A's credentials. Note that B is 
<a href="politeness.html">polite</a> and 
not at all insulting.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "Listen up, asshole. All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a 
rodent, so it can't be a mammal."
<br>B: "Yet another ad hominem argument. Ignore this one, folks."
</i></blockquote>

<p>A is abusive, and his argument is fallacious, but it's not ad hominem.
B's reply, ironically, <i>is</i> ad hominem; while he pretends to deal with
A's argument, in using the term "ad hominem" incorrectly, B is in fact trying 
to dismiss the argument by imputing that A is resorting to personal attacks.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "Listen up, asshole. All rodents are mammals, and a lizard isn't a 
mammal, so it can't be a rodent."
<br>B: "Yet another ad hominem argument. Ignore this one, folks."
</i></blockquote>

<p>A's argument is sound, and not ad hominem. B's reply is again ad hominem.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "B is a convicted criminal and his arguments are not to be trusted."
<br>B: "Yet another ad hominem argument. Ignore this one, folks."
</i></blockquote>

<p>A's argument is ad hominem, since it attempts to undermine all of B's
(hypothetical) arguments by a personal attack. B's reply is not
ad hominem, since it directly addresses A's argument (correctly characterising
it as ad hominem).

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All politicians are assholes, and you're just another politician. Therefore, you're an asshole."
<br>B: "Yet another ad hominem argument."
</i></blockquote>

<p>If you accept the premises, A's argument is sound. Either way, from the given 
context, 
we cannot conclude that it is ad hominem: it's not an attempt to undermine B's (hypothetical)
arguments by abusing him, but instead an attempt to establish that B is an asshole.
B's reply is ad hominem, since by incorrectly using the term "ad hominem", he is trying 
to undermine A's argument by claiming that A is resorting to personal attacks.

</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All politicians are liars, and you're just another politician. Therefore, 
you're a liar and your arguments are not to be trusted."<br>B: "Yet another ad 
hominem argument."
</i></blockquote>

<p>If you accept the premises, A's argument is sound; but I think most of us 
would sympathise with B and class it as fallacious, and ad hominem. This is 
because we do not accept the premise that all politicians are liars. There is a 
false premise that lies behind all ad hominem arguments: the notion that all 
people of type X make bad arguments. A has just made this premise explicit.


</p><blockquote><i>
A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be a
mammal."
<br>B: "That does not logically follow."
<br>A: "*Sigh* Do I have to spell it out for you? All rodents are mammals, right,
but a weasel <b>isn't</b> a rodent, so it <b>can't</b> be a mammal! What's so hard
to understand—!?"
<br>B: "I'm afraid you're mistaken. Look at it logically. If p implies q, then
it does not follow that not-p implies not-q."
<br>A: "I don't care about so-called logic and Ps and Qs and that stuff, I'm talking
COMMON SENSE. A weasel ISN'T a mammal."
<br>B: "Okay, this guy's an idiot. Ignore this one, folks."
<br>A: "AD HOMINEM!!!! I WIN!!!!!"
</i></blockquote>

<p>Although the last line of B, taken out of context, might look
ad hominem (and was seized upon as such by A), it should be clear that taken
as a whole, B's argument is not ad hominem. B engaged thoroughly with A's argument.
He is not countering A's argument by saying A is an idiot; on the contrary, having
logically countered A's argument, and having seen A's reaction, he is 
<i>arguing</i> that A is an idiot.
