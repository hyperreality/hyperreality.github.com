<p><b>Update 30/3/2011:</b>

Over the years, a lot of people have triumphantly pointed out that the 
effect I describe below is due to a printing error in the books. But so 
what? That barely affects a word I've written. The point of this article 
-- and this is <i>obvious</i>, people -- is not Steve Jackson worship. 
The point of this article is to describe a remarkable moment of CYOA 
gameplay in <i>Creature of Havoc</i>.

</p><p><a href="author.html">Authorial intention</a> 
is significant, but it isn't everything. That something amazing happened 
by accident doesn't make it any less amazing. It's worth pointing out, 
though, that the better a work is in the first place, the more probable 
a random accident will turn it into something special. The effect I 
describe below is not <i>solely</i> due to a printing error, but due to 
the happy interaction between the error and themes already present in 
the book; Steve Jackson at least had to put these interesting themes in 
there. A similar error in an Ian Livingstone book would most probably 
turn it into even worse garbage.

</p><p> If it bothers you that Steve Jackson isn't 
responsible for something awesome about his gamebook, just think of 
it as "emergent gameplay" and move on. But if you really need to believe 
the "genius" of a work has to be embodied in some purposeful agent, 
rest assured, I've now given credit where it's due.

<h4><i>Creature of Havoc</i> (Fighting Fantasy Gamebook #24)
<br>by Steve Jackson, some sloppy proofreaders, and Fate herself</h4>

<p>We've been having some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130531024653/http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.int-fiction/browse_frm/thread/950c6c85665dd48a/a5e978fcf4a4fd62?lnk=gst&amp;q=enumerated+actions#a5e978fcf4a4fd62">discussion</a> on RGIF recently about enumerated actions 
and their effect on IF gameplay, and I have been siding with the argument 
that the effect is not good. According to this argument, choosing from a 
set of M*N explicitly enumerated actions (as in a LucasArts adventure 
game) tends to distance the player from the game world, makes it seem like 
a contrivance, reduces gameplay to uninvolved hotspot-clicking. When 
instead you do not know the full set of actions (as in command-line IF), 
you must immerse yourself in the world to find out what is possible, 
engage with the game world on a much deeper level.

</p><p>By this argument, the CYOA books so beloved of my childhood would make 
the worst IF of all. The <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> series had a maximum of 
400 possible actions per book, one per reference number, with only three 
or four available at any one time. These actions are always explicitly 
offered to the player. Pretty severe limitations: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130531024653/http://www.eblong.com/zarf/essays/ifdef.html">Andrew Plotkin</a> 
even argues that CYOA books shouldn't 
count as interactive fiction.

</p><blockquote>
"My problem with CYOA games
(or books) is that the range of action is never uncertain -- you *can*
progress mechanically, by trying every menu possibility. In fact, this
is what usually happens when I play a CYOA game."
</blockquote>

<p>And indeed, childhood nostalgia aside, the <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> books 
for the most part made dull games, and worse fiction. The exceptions, at 
least as far as games were concerned, were the works of Steve Jackson, who 
wrote a succession of increasingly intricate books, using every trick 
possible to raise the game above arbitrary page-flicking. His final 
gamebook, <i>Creature of Havoc</i>, is surely the crowning masterpiece of 
the genre. In its own modest way, it's close to being a work of genius.

</p><p>I should emphasise at this point that the genius lies in the 
<i>game</i>, and not in the prose, which is functional and competent, or 
the story, which is uninspired genre-fantasy fare. In the story, you play 
a hideous dungeon monster, the creature of the title, a foul creation of 
sorcery; it turns out later that the aim of the game is to meet and 
destroy your maker. But to do that you must first escape from the 
<a href="dungeon.html">dungeon</a>, 
and you face an immediate problem: you are a creature of instinct, with no 
reason, no free will, no control over your actions. For the first few 
turns, you wander mindlessly around the dungeon, all of your choices 
dictated by dice rolls. Soon you blunder into a party of cliched RPG 
dungeon adventurers. They scream at you in some impenetrable code; you 
can't understand human speech. You attack them, kill them, eat them.

</p><p>But as you're searching for more to eat, you accidentally 
break open one of the adventurers' possessions. A ghostly vapour seeps 
out, forms a face, and says something to you. You don't understand, but 
after the vapour speaks, you find that you have control over your actions. 
From this point on in the book, you can choose any of the options 
available to you, as in a normal CYOA. (You find out later that you broke 
open the Vapour of Reason, one of three magic vapours the adventurers were 
searching for. Soon afterwards, you find the Vapour of Language, and can 
decipher the coded speech. But I reach ahead.)

</p><p>A while later, if you choose the right path, you can find a magic 
pendant that turns out to be essential for escaping the dungeon. Vital 
quest items like this always presented a problem for CYOA books. The 
standard <i>FF</i> hack, like Ian Livingstone, would offer you a choice 
like "If you have the magic pendant, go to reference 123", at which point 
you say "sure, I have it right here!", and go to reference 123. The more 
canny writer tells you to "subtract the number written on the pendant from 
this reference number, and go to to that new reference", which prevents 
cheating, but still means the game is a matter of randomly having the 
right item. Jackson goes one better: when you find the pendant, he tells 
you that when you come across a paragraph beginning "You cannot see a 
thing...", you can use the pendant by subtracting 20 from the number of 
that paragraph. And so not only is the choice hidden from players lacking 
a pendant, but also the reader has to pay attention and follow clues in 
the text. What was arbitrary page-flicking is now a game.

</p><p>But still not a very good game. The player is still <i>told</i> all
the actions that are available; and now, if you have the pendant, at the
"You cannot see a thing..." paragraph you just choose from three available 
options instead of two. So you can still progress mechanically.

</p><p>Of course, when you come to that paragraph you decide to use the 
pendant and subtract 20 from the reference number. You are then told the 
pendant's special ability (detecting secret doors), and told that when you 
come to a paragraph that begins "You find yourself...' you may subtract 20 
from the reference number and use the pendant again.

</p><p>Eventually, you come to a paragraph that begins "You find yourself at a 
dead end." You use the pendant again, subtracting 20 from the reference, 
which reveals a door to a secret room. But the secret room is useless -- 
in fact, it's an obvious deathtrap. You don't enter.

</p><p>Soon afterwards, you come to realise that you are moving around in 
circles. All the ways out of the circle seem fatal -- apart from a 
seemingly pointless dead end. But the dead end paragraph begins "You reach 
a dead end" and not "You find yourself...". You can't use the pendant 
here... or can you?

</p><p>And here lies the game's moment of genius, the moment where the CYOA 
game breaks out of the CYOA genre. For to escape from the dungeon, you 
have to decide to take an action, yourself, that has been offered to you 
nowhere in the text. You must put yourself in the the creature's 
situation, reason about where you are and what clues you have been given. 
And though the action you decide to take runs against everything you've 
been led to expect about the CYOA genre, it does not seem unfair; in fact, 
when it occurs to you, you know it must be right. When you deduct 20 
from the reference, you expect that a secret door will be revealed -- and 
it is!

</p><p>The remarkable thing is that your leap in understanding mirrors the 
creature's earlier leap in understanding. For what is a CYOA player other 
than a slave to the options presented to him, unable to come up with 
decisions for himself, never the master of his own fate? It's as if the 
game demands that <i>you</i> earn the right to escape from the dungeon 
along with the creature. You must stop blindly following the choices given 
to you, and instead rebel against them, and think for yourself. You too 
must acquire the "Vapour of Reason", or be trapped forever in a dark 
dungeon.

</p><p>And that, in brief, is what makes <i>CoH</i> the only CYOA that is also 
IF.
