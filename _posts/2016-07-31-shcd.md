The 1981 mystery game _Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective_ is ranked as one of the [best 100 board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective), but until recently you could only play it ten times before you ran out of cases. Following the 2015 reprint of the game, several fans have created and published excellent cases of their own. This table aims to keep track of these cases in a clean format:
