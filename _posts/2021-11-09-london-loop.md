title: Walking and Ranking the London LOOP
permalink: /london-loop
tags: walking london
---

The London LOOP is a 150 mile (242 km) circular walk that takes you through green areas on the edge of Greater London. My motivation for completing this is that I really enjoyed [walking the Capital Ring](/capital-ring), and wanted to set a more ambitious challenge.

Once again I am rating each section and listing good, bad, and unexpected moments.

![](/assets/loop/map.jpg)

The [TfL website](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/walking/loop-walk) has official maps for the route, but I instead highly recommend [this guidebook](https://www.colinsaunders.org.uk/london-loop/) for detailed instructions and interesting historical facts.

### LOOP vs Capital Ring

On the whole, I enjoyed walking the LOOP more than the Capital Ring. That's because a big part of walking for me is getting away from the hustle and bustle, and the LOOP is naturally quieter being further out from the centre. However this also means that it takes longer to travel to.

Compared to the Capital Ring, the highs of the LOOP are higher and the lows are lower. The best parts of the LOOP (like spectacular views across the city) are amazing but the worst parts (like walking down a main road next to an asphalt plant) are dreadful. On some sections the bad parts cancel out the good parts, but on other sections, the walking is excellent all the way.

So overall, I'd recommend starting with the Capital Ring, as a more consistent, accessible, and historically interesting walk. I also think that my [blog post](/capital-ring) on the Capital Ring is a better read. But the best sections of the LOOP are what I'd most like to see again.

## <a name="1"></a> 1 - Erith to Old Bexley
#### Rating: 2/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/1good.jpg)
Walking along the Crayford Marshes give a strong sense of isolation. It's interesting to learn about the flood defenses, and there were plenty of dragonflies to spot in summer in summer.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/1bad.jpg)
It's a real shame that the first LOOP section is the most desolate and grim one. Much time is spent alongside noisy and smelly industrial yards, and the latter part of the walk is utterly forgettable. On the other hand, the atmosphere of the first half of the section is memorable and gives context to London and the rest of the walk.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/1unexpected.jpg)
On my first attempt at the LOOP with friends a decade ago, a road repair crew was blocking off this pavement on the A2. It was impossible to reach the footpath without walking on the road, which we did, and got shouted at by the foreman for "walking dangerously". Could that blue barrier be a leftover from his work?

## <a name="2"></a> 2 - Old Bexley to Petts Wood
#### Rating: 8/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/2good.jpg)
Foots Cray Meadows is absolutely beautiful. Besides that, there's a variety of nice moments, including Sidcup Place Park, Scadbury Manor, and Petts Wood.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/2bad.jpg)
A busy junction spoils the village atmosphere of Foots Cray. Later, you have to navigate the multi-level roundabout "Frognal Corner".
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/2unexpected.jpg)
A group of baby moorhens were waddling around the remains of Scudbury Moated Manor, how cute! Petts Wood has a sundial as a monument to William Willett, a leading advocate of daylight saving time. I'm sure daylight savings made sense a century ago, but it's a silly practice today.

## <a name="3"></a> 3 - Petts Wood to West Wickham Common
#### Rating: 9/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/3good.jpg)
From Farnborough onwards this section becomes sensational walking. Huge open spaces but always varied and interesting. By the time I had passed the Wilberforce Oak and reached Keston Ponds, I had not seen another human in 45 minutes! And that's on a summer Saturday afternoon within Greater London. Maybe everyone had gone to the beach.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/3bad.jpg)
The track next to Shire Lane near Holwood Farm was overgrown with stinging nettles. Ouch.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/3unexpected.jpg)
I didn't expect to catch this robin in the height of summer.

## <a name="4"></a> 4 - West Wickham Common to Hamsey Green
#### Rating: 8/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/4good.jpg)
Spectacular views over London from Addington Hills. Heathfield House was lovely but the loop doesn't dwell there for long. Overall, the section barely lets up in offering green space after green space.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/4bad.jpg)
The section has so many woods and hills, it lacks variety like ponds/lakes.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/4unexpected.jpg)
I was taken by surprise by this horse-shaped fallen tree. Encountered in the haunted Baker Boy Lane, where the section leaves Croydon and enters Surrey. It's interesting just how much of the best woodland around here is owned by the City of London.

## <a name="5"></a> 5 - Hamsey Green to Coulsdon South
#### Rating: 10/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/5good.jpg)
Farthing Downs has simply the best view out of anywhere I've seen in my London walks. The rest of the walk is a great lead-up to it, with Riddlesdown Park, Kenley Common, Happy Valley, and Devil's Den Woods. Outstanding all the way.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/5bad.jpg)
The loop goes on a long northwards diversion around Riddlesdown Quarry. Because I was trying to get back before sunset, I decided to take a more direct route around the south of the quarry, marked on OpenStreetMaps. I soon discovered why this route is not part of the official walk.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/5unexpected.jpg)
My second detour was around the Kenley Aerodrome, which should perhaps be part of the official route. Surprisingly, despite scary Ministry of Defence signs, families were playing on the airfield.

## <a name="6"></a> 6 - Coulsdon South to Banstead Downs
#### Rating: 6/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/6good.jpg)
Once this section gets going, it's great, with a lot of variety, keeping you engaged. It's a shame that more time isn't spent in Oaks Park; I wandered into the main area and it was very nice.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/6bad.jpg)
The starting stretch is infuriating, spending half an hour going up residential roads, with green spaces beckoning from the sides which you don't enter. When the trail finally gets off the road (pictured), it was overgrown and infested with flies. Later, the A217 which divides Banstead Downs golf course is one of the worst road crossings on the LOOP.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/6unexpected.jpg)
One moment I was fighting through an overgrown track, the next I was suddenly in the beautiful lavender fields of Mayfield Farm, teeming with amateur photographers.

## <a name="7"></a> 7 - Banstead Downs to Ewell
#### Rating: 2/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/7good.jpg)
Ewell has plenty of interesting historical buildings, and a quaint villagey vibe when you first emerge into it. The effect is soon spoiled by a number of busy roads, but at least it lasts for a few brief moments.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/7bad.jpg)
The first half of the section is spent walking on pavements in Surrey suburbia. Yes, half of the whole section.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/7unexpected.jpg)
Nonsuch Park is apparently heaven for dogs, with them running amok in greater numbers than I have seen in any other park.

## <a name="8"></a> 8 - Ewell to Kingston Bridge
#### Rating: 2/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/8good.jpg)
Hogsmill Open Space and Elmbridge Meadows are tranquil, and the approach into Kingston is pretty.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/8bad.jpg)
This stroll along the Hogsmill River starts pleasantly enough, but three necessary diversions from the riverside go on to ruin it. The first sees you miss the location where Millais painted his masterpiece [Ophelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophelia_(painting)) since the path disappears (pictured). The next sees you walk a fair way up the horrible A3 just to find a subway then walk all the way down again on the other side. The last sends you down dull roads past a sewage plant. To top it off, the signage throughout was in a poor state.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/8unexpected.jpg)
Kingston was packed and looked almost Mediterranean when I arrived there. A heron was watching under the bridge. It was nice after such a disappointing walk.

## <a name="9"></a> 9 - Kingston Bridge to Hatton Cross
#### Rating: 6/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/9good.jpg)
Bushy Park is beautiful, enchanting, full of wildlife, and without doubt one of the best experiences on the entire LOOP. Hounslow Heath is intriguingly wild.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/9bad.jpg)
The middle part really lets this section down with the large amount of residential walking. Still, it's interesting watching the character of the streets slowly change between Hampton Hill (pictured) and Hounslow.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/9unexpected.jpg)
This boarded up and graffitied white building in Hounslow Cemetery, combined with the towering estates and planes overhead, gives the graveyard a spooky feel. Why do so many of the place names in this section begin with the letter "H"? Hampton, Hanworth, Hounslow, Heathrow, Hatton Cross...

## <a name="10"></a> 10 - Hatton Cross to Hayes & Harlington
#### Rating: 3/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/10good.jpg)
Cranford Park is lovely, with big open fields, red cows, a church, and a striking stable blockyard. I would have used a photo of the cows but they were covered in flies and looked fed up about it.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/10bad.jpg)
Several encounters with loud and busy roads overshadow the nicer parts of this short section. The route sends you 200 metres down the A4 just to walk through the unremarkable Berkeley Meadows, despite there being a cut-through around the back. Later you walk beside the even louder A312 next to an asphalt plant.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/10unexpected.jpg)
Hard to believe this idyllic scene is encountered just off the A30 nearby the huge British Airways engineering headquarters.

## <a name="11"></a> 11 - Hayes & Harlington to Uxbridge
#### Rating: 8/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/11good.jpg)
The Colne Valley Park stretch here is fantastic. The canalside walking which makes up the bulk of this section is almost as good, with a fun diversion through a business park and golf course.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/11bad.jpg)
The Grand Union Canal at Hayes Town at the beginning of this section was in a grim state, full of litter, and with no bird life to be seen apart from a flock of morbid pigeons living under a bridge. To stay positive I'm using a picture from further up the canal instead.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/11unexpected.jpg)
Whoever dumped this near Packet Boat Marina does not have a healthy lifestyle. Shortly after, I had to scramble off the track as two dirt bikers came tearing up the towpath.

## <a name="12"></a> 12 - Uxbridge to Harefield West
#### Rating: 7/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/12good.jpg)
Plenty more pleasant walking alongside the Grand Union Canal, and the associated locks, marinas, and lakes near it.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/12bad.jpg)
Recognising that too much canalside walking on a narrow towpath can become monotonous, the route diverts off round Harefield Marina. However, I didn't feel this diversion was justified; you get nice views of the lake but shortly turn off and have to walk down a road just to get back on the towpath again.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/12unexpected.jpg)
"Fran's Tea Garden" next to Denham Deep Lock looked so quaint and inviting in the summer sun.

## <a name="13"></a> 13 - Harefield West to Moor Park
#### Rating: 7/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/13good.jpg)
Bishop's Wood Country Park was somewhere I'd like to explore further, and the walking around it was good although a little hemmed in by the clearly marked private farmland all around. I got lost but it was worth it as I stumbled upon rows upon rows of foxgloves.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/13bad.jpg)
Across the road from the Rose and Crown pub at Woodcock Hill, a pack of assorted dogs came bolting over to the fence to bark furiously. Shortly after, a tough-looking man had to fully exert himself to stop his slavering German Shepherd from charging at me. Later on, I saw somebody else almost become a victim of a dog. What is wrong with the dogs round this part of Outer London?
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/13unexpected.jpg)
The Moor Park Estate is almost comical in how exclusively it presents itself. So many signs, including an electronic one just to animate "No Through Road". The estate sums up the vibe of this section for me, rather lovely yet deliberately unwelcoming.

## <a name="14"></a> 14 - Moor Park to Hatch End
#### Rating: 8/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/14good.jpg)
This section was great all the way through, featuring a golf course, expansive playing fields, quiet roads, lush woods, and a farm. Just when I thought it was a shame it lacked any really notable sights, the gorgeous Pinnerwood House appeared. 
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/14bad.jpg)
The anti-bike measures deployed throughout the section were both ineffective and slightly annoying. Towards the end, the stiles were in various states of disrepair.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/14unexpected.jpg)
I got stuck behind a family whose grandmother refused to cross a stile with a horse blocking the other side (not the same place/horse as pictured). The others tried to shoo it off but it wouldn't budge. Eventually I got tired of waiting and climbed over, squeezing right past the horse, and after I politely said "excuse me" it moved away!

## <a name="15"></a> 15 - Hatch End to Elstree
#### Rating: 6/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/15good.jpg)
Aldenham Reservoir. The woodland in the middle of the section is very nice indeed. The trees are planted far apart, there's hardly anyone about, the ground gently undulates, there's history concerning W.S. Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan fame. To top it off there's a mysterious telecommunications station.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/15bad.jpg)
The beginning was so overgrown I could barely see the path. More generally, there's a lot of walking along and crossing of busy roads in this section, which sadly interrupts the variety of pleasant areas.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/15unexpected.jpg)
At the end of the section in the woods just before Elstree. I had a strange encounter. I heard a harsh, derisive voice shout "are you married?" and saw a shirtless man walking briskly towards me. I passed him and headed towards the source of the shout, a lady just standing there wearing a hoodie and orange reflective sunglasses. She suddenly barked at me "don't speak!" even though I certainly had no intention to. As I got closer, she asked "it's a lovely day, isn't it?" I ignored her and she started cursing at me. Charming. 

## <a name="16"></a> 16 - Elstree to Cockfosters
#### Rating: 5/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/16good.jpg)
The village of Monken Hadley is straight from another century. Other parts of this section further support the idea that North London has the most enchanting woodlands.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/16bad.jpg)
The one mile slog up and down the A1 was the lowest point of the entire LOOP. The amount of pollution inhaled from passing traffic probably cancelled out much of the exercise benefits. Shame, because the section was really nice otherwise.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/16unexpected.jpg)
An informal route through Woodcock Hill Village Green, presented by the guidebook, was miles better than the official start of the section.

## <a name="17"></a> 17 - Cockfosters to Enfield Lock
#### Rating: 9/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/17good.jpg)
This section gets off to a fantastic start, with the scene above mere minutes from Cockfosters Station. After that, this section recalls Section 3 in terms of feeling like you're anywhere but London. Peaceful rural walking almost all the way through, yet varied enough that it never feels dull.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/17bad.jpg)
The path along Salmon's Brook was poor and overgrown. Fortunately it looked like the Enfield Greenway was well under way, and it was possible to use its wide red path instead.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/17unexpected.jpg)
I probably differ from most LOOP walkers in that I don't stop for pub lunches. I just bring a sandwich and bottle of water. But the Rose & Crown made me the most tempted I've been so far to stop off for a pint and some chips.

## <a name="18"></a> 18 - Enfield Lock to Chingford
#### Rating: 8/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/18good.jpg)
Short and sweet section, with great woodlands and stunning views from Lippitts Hill of the reservoirs that provide a quarter of London's water supply.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/18bad.jpg)
Due to the metal fences, the River Lee Navigation part feels rather boxed in. Later on, it's a shame that you have to march directly down or parallel to Bury Road rather than exploring Epping Forest more.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/18unexpected.jpg)
The "Gardens of Firdaus" - wait, is this Middle Earth? Actually it's apparently a Muslim burial ground.

## <a name="19"></a> 19 - Chingford to Chigwell
#### Rating: 3/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/19good.jpg)
Roding Valley Recreation Ground has a very nice lake, and there are a couple of great views.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/19bad.jpg)
The section is chopped up into so many pieces by busy roads, a railway crossing, and a motorway crossing. And ends with a slog up to Chigwell. This is not much of a walk but more plumbing between the two great sections on either side.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/19unexpected.jpg)
It's amazing to think that this timber-framed hunting lodge has survived for almost 500 years.

## <a name="20"></a> 20 - Chigwell to Havering-atte-Bower
#### Rating: 9/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/20good.jpg)
Fantastic rural section that leaves the roar of the city far behind, featuring two country parks and plenty of farmland.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/20bad.jpg)
This was the most confusing and poorly signposted section overall. I had to rely on GPS a few times to navigate through the fields.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/20unexpected.jpg)
Shortly after Chigwell Water Treatment Works, it feels as if you're trespassing on a rich person's property. Through a gate and over a low wall you can see a ridiculously decked-out house and garden, which feels like a rare sight typically hiding behind high walls.

## <a name="21"></a> 21 - Havering-atte-Bower to Harold Wood
#### Rating: 7/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/21good.jpg)
It doesn't show up well on this photo, but the first part of this section has the best views since Farthing Downs in section 5. The area is stunning and one of the highlights of the entire LOOP.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/21bad.jpg)
This footbridge at Tench Pond Plantation was in an unsafe condition, unfortunately I couldn't figure out a way to report it to Havering council. The second part of the section gets a bit dull.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/21unexpected.jpg)
You expect to see deer in Richmond Park, not on a small green patch in the middle of suburbia (Harold Hill). Also unexpectedly, the normally reliable guidebook was full of errors, saying there are no stiles and giving incorrect directions in a few places.

## <a name="22"></a> 22 - Harold Wood to Upminster Bridge
#### Rating: 4/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/22good.jpg)
Pages Wood is pleasant, with random animal carvings and poems, and there's some nice fields at the end of the section. 
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/22bad.jpg)
You know it's a boring section when the guidebook points out this embossed oak like it's some notable local sight. I even saw another house with the same design on the way.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/22unexpected.jpg)
Had some angry farmer added this barrier to make a point that walkers should go away? The footpath just before this was in a treacherous state too.

## <a name="23"></a> 23 - Upminster Bridge to Rainham
#### Rating: 7/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/23good.jpg)
The Ingrebourne Valley offers a long stretch of quiet strolling, with historical interest in the form of WWII defences. And a huge amount of benches, exercise equipment, and a mountain bike park.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/23bad.jpg)
Rainham Village was pretty but the roads around it were horribly congested with cars trying to get to the Tesco superstore.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/23unexpected.jpg)
There was no litter or graffiti at all inside the pillboxes.

## <a name="24"></a> 24 - Rainham to Purfleet
#### Rating: ?/10
#### The Good:
![](/assets/loop/24good.jpg)
This was more interesting than the Erith section, with plenty to see including D-Day concrete barges, silos where Tilda rice is made, and funny pirate graves. I'm not giving this section a rating, as although it felt like a grim slog in a few places, it was also fascinating to see the residual industries on the edge of London.
#### The Bad:
![](/assets/loop/24bad.jpg)
The guidebook describes these as a "hell's cave of concrete pillars", but even worse is what follows it, the path besides Ferry Lane. It was so overgrown that it was like wading through thorns. Despite walking besides a rubbish tip for miles, there was nowhere to put my litter.
#### The Unexpected:
![](/assets/loop/24unexpected.jpg)
Unless I missed something, there was no sign or point heralding the end of the LOOP. This last waymarker, with some grey tape over the man, was all I could find.
