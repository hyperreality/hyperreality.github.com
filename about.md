Hi, I'm Laurence, an application security consultant based in London, UK. Welcome to my site!

I've been obsessed with computer security for a long time, so that's the main topic of the blog. I love being in a field that constantly challenges me to understand things at a deeper level.

More broadly I enjoy solving puzzles, so there's posts here about word games, puzzle video games, and Internet mysteries.

In my holidays I like to go on long cycling and hiking adventures - the blog also has trip reports of these.

My more technical articles are on other blogs; some picks:

 - [Vulnerabilities in Open Source C2 Frameworks](https://blog.includesecurity.com/2024/09/vulnerabilities-in-open-source-c2-frameworks/)
 - [Hunting For Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities Using GitHub CodeSearch and grep.app](https://blog.includesecurity.com/2022/07/hunting-for-mass-assignment-vulnerabilities-using-github-codesearch-and-grep-app/)
 - [Cracking a Chinese Proxy Tunnel: Real World CTF Personal Proxy Writeup](https://blog.cryptohack.org/cracking-chinese-proxy-realworldctf)
